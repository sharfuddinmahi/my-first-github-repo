        <p>iam  a curious, hardworking student who doesn’t pretend to understand things—you actually want to understand them./n Whether it’s C programming, DSA, DBMS, math, accounting, or microprocessors, you keep digging until it makes sense in a simple, practical way.

iam from CCE at IIUC, focused on web development, but you don’t limit yourself—you jump across subjects when exams or assignments demand it. You often say “easy kore bujai daw” 😄, which tells me you value clarity over fancy words.
